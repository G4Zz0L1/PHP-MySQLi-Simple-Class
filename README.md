# PHP-MySQLi-Simple-Class

A simple class for handling MySQLi connection and querying on PHP

Put both files in a /config/ folder on your project and you're good to go.

The config file is a sample on what you have to include in the folder, the mysql.class.php it's (quite) self documented.

As soon as I have time I'll create a proper README
